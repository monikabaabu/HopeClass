//The program must accept N integers from 1 to N in any order as the input.
// The program must print the minimum number of swaps required to order those N integers in ascending order as the output.
//
//        Boundary Condition(s):
//
//        1≤N≤1000
//Input Format:
//The first line contains N.
//The second line contains N integers separated by a space.
//
//Output Format:
//The first line contains the minimum number of swaps required.
//
//Example Input/Output 1:
//Input:
//
//        5
//        23154
//Output:
//
//        3
//Explanation:
//The integers 5 and 4 can be swapped.
//Now the integers become 23145.
//Then the integers 2 and 1 can be swapped.
//Now the integers become 13245.
//Then the integers 3 and 2 can be swapped.
//Now the integers become 12345.
//So at least 3 swaps are required.
//        Hence 3 is printed.
//
//Example Input/Output 2:
//Input:
//
//        7
//        2763541
//Output:
//
//        4
